    "Now we have these, lets explore generators a bit more. I would like to show it are free monoids. \n",
    "A monoid is a algebraic structure with the following properties: \n",
    "\n",
    "It has a set *M*. An operation *(+)* that can add members of *M* together and will yield a new element of *M* and a special member *e* of *M* called unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further more the operation (+) is closed, that means that for every two members of *M* we get a new element of *M* and never go outside of *M*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write down some rules for the monoid (a and b are members of M):\n",
    "\n",
    "a + (b + c) = (a + b) + b (associativity)\n",
    "a + e = e + a = a  (identity)\n",
    "\n",
    "And certain monoids are commutative:\n",
    "\n",
    "a + b = b + a (commutativity)\n",
    "\n",
    "if a,b are members of M then so is a+b (closure)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of monoids are the natural numbers, lists of elements and void in programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is a special monoid, that can turn every set S of objects into a monoid. This is called the Free monoid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are free monoids. We can lift all objects of set S in a list like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "M* = { List(x) for every x in S }\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is not a monoid yet, because we lack the structure. For example the above set M* misses the unit. So let's create that. First we tack on the empty list:\n",
    "\n",
    "M = M* U { List() } \n",
    "\n",
    "List concatenation will be our operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not hard to show this indeed follow the rules, but I am not going to do that here. \n",
    "\n",
    "So that is nice, we can turn every set of objects into an monoid. That is why it is called free!\n",
